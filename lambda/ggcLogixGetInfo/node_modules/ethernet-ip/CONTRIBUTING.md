**Submitting Issues** 

Contributing to the Code is great but feedback on the project is just as important.

1. Research to make sure the issue isn't already being tracked
2. Submit your issue via the project [issue tracker](https://github.com/cmseaton42/node-ethernet-ip/issues)
    - Be Clear
    - Be Thorough (too much information >>> not enough information)
    - Include Pictures (Screenshots of Errors, gifs, etc)
    - Include *Node Version* -> `node --version`
    - Include *package version* -> `npm list`

**Protip:** Use the project [Issue Template](https://github.com/cmseaton42/node-ethernet-ip/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point
